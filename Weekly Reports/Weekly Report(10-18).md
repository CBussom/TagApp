+ ## Mahima Abraham
    + **Goals of last week:**
      + Connect the history tab to the database.
      + Try connecting the tag button to the Bluetooth connection, meaning if the player is in range the button is enabled or else disabled and apply it to the actual app.
      + Start working on the leaderboard and its layout and the type of data it will display(players' rank, wins, losses, etc.)
      + Continue finding more features to implement like giving players option to share their leaderboard with others, push notifications, etc. 
    + **Progress and Issues:**
      + Still working on how to get the tag button go hand in hand with the bluetooth connection once the bluetooth is up and running.
      + Still looking into how to implement to the leaderboard and display the data for the players to use.
      + Trying to find more features to implement for the GUI
      + Currently have no issues.   
    + **Next Week's Goals:**
      + Finish(if possible) having the tag button go hand in hand with the Bluetooth.
      + Start implementing different features I have found(implemented on my own project) to our GUI and working on getting the frameworks or looks of the app improved.
      + Start(continue looking into) implementing the leaderboard that will be connected to the database.
      + Look into how to connect the leaderboard to the database.
