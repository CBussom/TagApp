# TagApp

# ***Idea of the Project***
+ #### TeleTag is a mobile app that people can download to play tag with their friends. The game will have different rooms that players can join to play tag with each other. Their phones’ Bluetooth will help them find other players and once they are in range their tag button will be enabled. Once the player is out of the range to tag another player, their button will be disabled. There will be a leader board that displays the player’s rankings, wins, and losses.

# ***Goals of the Project***
1. #### Set up bluetooth to detect players range among other each other.
2. #### Be able to connect to bluetooth devices and send data through them.
3. #### Recognize devices that are currently in the game. 
4. #### Create a database to store players information which will be connected to the leaderboard. 
5. #### Create a leaderboard that displays players' losses, wins, and ranking.

# ***Stretch Goals of the Project***
1. #### Have different game modes such as elimination round, multiple taggers, etc.
2. #### Have a map system that shows all the players within the proxitmity of the tagger. 

# ***Layout of Git-Repo***
